##Welcome!

This application showcases Ruby on Rails and how it can work together with Vue.js

This is a similar application concept to  [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/). Users can sign up and create teams by inviting other users to sign up with just a name and email address.

Invited users should receive an email and be directed to a page where they create a password. From there, team members can create, update, and destroy individual projects.

Big shoutout to the owners of [GoRails.com](https://gorails.com/)  and [Web-Crunch](https://web-crunch.com/) for showing me how to integrate Vue with the Rails backend.
